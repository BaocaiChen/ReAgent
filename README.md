Retrosynthetic planning is a critical task in organic chemistry which identifies a series of reactions that can lead to the synthesis of a target product.
This project is aim to leveage large language model in retrosynthesis planning.And the work now is based on the PDVN and Retro* algorithm.
Please download the dataset and checkpoint of onestep model from this link.
