Retrosynthetic planning is a critical task in organic chemistry which identifies a series of reactions that can lead to the synthesis of a target product.

This project is aim to leveage large language model in retrosynthesis planning.And the work now is based on the PDVN and Retro* algorithm.

Please download the dataset and checkpoint of onestep model from this link.[dataset](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/D1OSWw),[onr_step_model](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/I1e77C),[results](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/E1hTDE)
