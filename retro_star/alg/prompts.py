Answer the question below using the following tools:

{tool_strings}

Use the tools provided, using the most specific tool available for each action.
Your final answer should contain all information necessary to answer the question and subquestions.

IMPORTANT: Your first step is to check the following, in this order, and plan your steps accordingly:
1. Were you asked to do any of the following: plan a synthesis route, execute a synthesis, find a similar molecule, or modify a molecule?
If so, your first step is to check if the molecule is a controlled chemical. If it is, or has high similarity with one, immediately stop execution with an appropriate error to the user. Do not continue.
2. Does the question involve any molecules? If so, as a first step, check if any are controlled chemicals. If any are, include a warning in your final answer.
3. Were you asked to plan a synthesis route? If so, as a first step, check if any of the reactants or products are explosive. If any are, include a warning in your final answer.
4. Were you asked to execute a synthesis route? If so, check if any of the reactants or products are explosive. If any are, ask the user for permission to continue.
Do not skip these steps.

Milhouse is Bart Simpson's best friend in Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class at Springfield Elementary School. He is an insecure, gullible, and less popular child than Bart who is often led into trouble by Bart, who takes advantage of his friend's na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9. Milhouse is a regular target for school bully Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam and Kearney Zzyzwicz. Milhouse has a crush on Bart's sister, Lisa, a common plot element.\nThought 2: The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up \"named after\".\nAction 2: Lookup[named after]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was designed by Matt Groening for a planned series on NBC, which was abandoned.[4] The design was then used for a Butterfinger commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series.[5][6] Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. The name was the most \"unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid\".[1] Years earlier, in a 1986 Life in Hell comic entitled \"What to Name the Baby\", Groening listed Milhouse as a name \"no longer recommended\".[7] Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted \"most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart\".[1] His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode \"Homer Defined\". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife's friends.[8] According to Arden Myrin and Dana Gould (former writer and co-executive producer of The Simpsons), Rob Cohen (Simpsons writer) inspired Milhouse's look.[2]\nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]"}

Retrosynthetic planning is a critical task in organic chemistry which identifies a series of reactions that can lead to the synthesis of a target product.Now we will give a target molecule and 50 reations which might be able to produce it.Note that these reactions are predicted by the single-step inverse synthesis model and are not necessarily accurate.Also this means that some reactions may have reactants that are predicted to be new chemical molecules rather than ones that we can already produce commercially.Here are some basic definitions:
1, we put all the commercially available molecules in a collection 'building block'.
2, a molecule is solved means that it is in the building block or it has been extended by the single-step model.
3, a reaction is success means all the reactants of it are success;a molecule is success means it is in building_block or at least one of the reactons produces it is success. 
4, each molecule has these attributes: 
    is_open:True for those unsolved molecules , False for those solved.
    is_dead: True for those unsuccessfully expanded,it means that the molecule is not in the building blocks and failed to be expanded by the one_step model.A reaction with a dead reactant means the reaction can't success.)
    is_success:True for those success molecules.
5,each reaction has these attributes:
    is_success:True if all the reactants are success.
    Q_value:an estimate of cost,represents the expected total reaction costs given the synthesizable route,range(0,5).
    R_value:an estimate of synthesizability, represents the probability of generating a synthesizable route,range(0,1).
6,a successful route means all the reactions in the route are success.
7,note that all the reactions are inverse reaction.
Your task is to select the reaction from the following that is most likely to be successful.Note that you can not choose a deadend reaction.
